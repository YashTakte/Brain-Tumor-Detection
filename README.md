# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain tumors are deadly and challenging diseases that can occur anywhere in the brain. Early detection and proper diagnosis are crucial for better treatment and outcomes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is effective in detecting brain tumors, but manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. This project presents a deep learning based approach for automated brain tumor detection using MRI data. The images are preprocessed and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for accurate tumor detection.

Here I have used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle called "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection". The dataset consists of 253 MRI images, where 155 images are of patients with brain tumors and 98 images are of healthy brains.
